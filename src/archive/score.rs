/// # Paginating
///
/// This request supports paginating in a quite inconvenient way:
/// One can only specify the [limit], the offset/skip can be only described by the [bookmark].
/// The [bookmark] works such as an iterator but with anchors.
/// E.g.: if `limit = 10` and `bookmark` is unset, the first 10 results will be shown.
/// Within this response, the server will return a `bookmark` string.
/// This string can be used in the next request in order to retrieve the next 10 results and so on.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `search_term`: a string to search for in the specified [attributes]
/// * `regex`: if `true` the [search_term] will be interpreted as a regular expression instead of a fuzzy search term
/// * `attributes`: the attributes to search for
/// * `book`: if set, the score must contain a page with exactly this book
/// * `location`: if set, the score must be have set a location with exact this string
/// * `sort`: the field which should be used to sort the results (database relative, not page)
/// * `ascending`: is unset or `true` the results will be sorted ascending, descending otherwise
/// * `limit`: the limit of documents for a result page
/// * `bookmark`: the bookmark used for pagination
///
/// returns: Result<Json<FindResponse<Score>>, Error>
