# OpenKeg Multi-Arch Docker Image

## Description
The OpenKeg Multi-Arch Docker Image is designed to build and run the 'openkeg' application on multiple architectures. This Docker image leverages the power of Rust and Alpine Linux to provide a lightweight and efficient environment for hosting OpenKeg. The image supports both ARM64 and AMD64 architectures, making it versatile and suitable for various deployment scenarios.

## Features
- Supports ARM64 and AMD64 architectures for broader compatibility.
- Based on Rust and Alpine Linux, ensuring a lightweight and efficient container environment.
- Built-in multi-stage build process for optimal image size and security.
- Customizable log levels and tracing for monitoring application behavior.
- Automatically exposes port 1926 for incoming connections.

## Usage
To use the OpenKeg Multi-Arch Docker Image, follow these steps:

1. Pull the Docker image:
   ```sh
   docker pull mvlat/openkeg:latest
   ```
1. Run the container with the desired configuration:
   ```sh
   docker run -d -p 1926:1926 -v /path/to/data:/data mvlat/openkeg
   ```
The `-p` flag maps port 1926 inside the container to the host, enabling incoming connections.
The `-v` flag allows you to mount a host directory as a volume for persistent data storage.

## Environment Variables:
The OpenKeg Docker Image supports the following environment variables:
- `RUST_BACKTRACE`: Set to 1 to enable backtraces in case of errors.
- `RUST_LOG`: Specifies the log level (e.g., debug, info, error).
- `RUST_LOG_STYLE`: Specifies the log style (e.g., always, auto, never).

## Build Configuration:
The build process is designed to be versatile, allowing you to specify the target architecture during the build. To build the image for a specific architecture, use the following command:

```sh
docker buildx build -t mvlat/openkeg:latest --platform=linux/amd64 --platform=linux/arm64 --progress=plain . --push
```
